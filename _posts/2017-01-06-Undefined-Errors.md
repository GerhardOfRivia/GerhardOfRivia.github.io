excerpt: Undefined Behavior I ask a question like this when I interview to see how people act with these question I think you can learn a lot of people with how they talk about these types of questions.

**Define Undefined Behavior**

Code, we think to know what it will do.

```
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void main () {
	printf("%d\n", (INT_MIN-1) < 0);
}
```

What will this print?

```
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void main () {
	for(int i = 0; i < INT_MAX+1; i++);
	printf("%d\n", (INT_MAX+1) < 0);
}
```

What about this? What will this print?

**Why Is Undefined Behavior Good?**

Undefined behavior simplifies the compilerâ€™s job, making it possible to generate very efficient code in certain situations.

```
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void add(int i, int p) {
	printf("%d\n", i+p);
}

void main () {
	int i = 0;
	add(++i, ++i);
}
```

**Why Is Undefined Behavior Bad?**

When programmers cannot be trusted to reliably avoid undefined behavior, we end up with programs that silently misbehave.

```
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void main () {
	for(int i = 0; i < INT_MAX+1; i++);
	printf("%d\n", (INT_MAX+1) < 0);
}
```
