excerpt: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange I made this when I had to explain this as a TA but just found it and thought it would be good to share.
---

A specific method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel and was one of the first public-key protocols as originally conceptualized by Ralph Merkle and named after Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. This is one of the earliest practical examples of public key exchange implemented within the field of cryptography.

**General overview**

Diffieâ€“Hellman Key Exchange establishes a shared secret between two parties that can be used for secret communication for exchanging data over a public network.
