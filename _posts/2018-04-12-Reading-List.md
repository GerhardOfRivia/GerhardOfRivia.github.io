Here is my 2018 read list,

+ **Ready Player One** is a 2011 science fiction novel, and the debut novel of American author Ernest Cline. The story, set in a dystopia in 2045, follows protagonist Wade Watts on his search for an Easter egg in a worldwide virtual reality game, the discovery of which would lead him to inherit the game creator's fortune.

+ **Off to Be the Wizard** follows Martin Banks is just a normal guy who has made an abnormal discovery: he can manipulate reality, thanks to reality being nothing more than a computer program.

+ **Spell or High Water: Magic 2.0** another adventure with Martin Banks

+ **The Last Wish** two collections of short stories preceding the main Witcher Saga, written by Polish fantasy writer Andrzej Sapkowski.

+ **Necronomicon** H.P. Lovecraft's reputation has grown tremendously over the decades, and he is now commonly regarded as one of the most important horror writers of the 20th century, exerting an influence that is widespread, though often indirect. So here is short story collection

+ **2001: A Space Odyssey** is a 1968 science fiction novel by British writer Arthur C. Clarke. It was developed concurrently with Stanley Kubrick's film version and published after the release of the film.

+ **The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy** is a comedy science fiction series created by Douglas Adams. Originally a radio comedy broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978, it was later adapted to other formats, including stage shows, novels, comic books, a 1981 TV series, a 1984 video game, and 2005 feature film.
