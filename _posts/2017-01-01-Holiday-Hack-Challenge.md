```

```
You are in room 17 of the cave, and have 1 arrow left.
*sniff* (I can smell the evil Wumpus nearby!)
There are tunnels to rooms 4, 10, and 15.
Move or shoot? (m-s) s 4
*thwock!* *groan* *crash*

A horrible roar fills the cave, and you realize, with a smile, that you
have slain the evil Wumpus and won the game!  You don't want to tarry for
long, however, because not only is the Wumpus famous, but the stench of
dead Wumpus is also quite well known, a stench plenty enough to slay the
mightiest adventurer at a single whiff!!

WUMPUS IS MISUNDERSTOOD
